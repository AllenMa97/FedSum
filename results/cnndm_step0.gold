in 2018 , the f - 35 program began operational testing . also in 2018 , the air force continued planning for the acquisition of abms , intended to modernize how dod maintains command and control over and manages the future battlefield . both the f - 35 and abms are expected to play key roles in dod 's modernization efforts . this testimony statement discusses ( 1 ) the f - 35 program 's development and modernization efforts , and progress in improving the aircraft 's r&m and ( 2 ) dod 's current planning efforts for abms . this statement is based on two gao reports on the f - 35 published in april 2019 and on gao 's ongoing work examining abms . to conduct this work , gao analyzed dod management reports ; discussed the efforts with program and contractor officials ; and compared both efforts to dod policy and gao acquisition best practices . the department of defense ( dod ) wrapped up the f - 35 development program in april 2018 and expects to complete operational testing in december 2019 . dod has turned its attention to modernization efforts ¡ª referred to as block 4 ¡ª to add new capabilities to address evolving threats . the program office estimates block 4 to cost at least $ 10.5 billion through 2024 . dod plans to start block 4 development without a complete business case identifying baseline cost and schedule estimates . key documents for establishing a business case , such as an independent cost estimate , will not be ready before the program plans to award block 4 development contracts in may 2019 ( see figure ) . without a business case ¡ª consistent with acquisition best practices ¡ª program officials can not be confident that the risk of committing to development has been reduced adequately prior to planned contract awards . the program made slow , sustained progress in improving the f - 35 's reliability and maintainability ( r&m ) . f - 35 aircraft are assessed against eight r&m metrics , which inform how much time the aircraft will be in maintenance rather than operations . half of these metrics are not meeting targets . while the program office has a plan for improving r&m , its guidance is not in line with gao 's acquisition best practices or internal control standards as it does not include specific , measurable objectives , align improvement projects to meet those objectives , and prioritize funding to match resources to r&m requirements . if the r&m requirements are not met , the warfighter will have to settle for a less reliable and more costly aircraft than originally planned . this contributes to the f - 35 's $ 1.12 trillion estimated sustainment costs and challenges with maintaining an expanding fleet that also has supply chain and logistics system problems . gao 's ongoing work indicates that the air force 's advanced battle management system ( abms ) ¡ª intended to provide battle management command and control and surveillance across air , land , and sea ¡ª is in the early stages of planning . the capabilities and the strategy to deliver those capabilities are still to be determined . the air force plans to manage abms as a family of systems , integrating sensors from existing and future weapons programs , and overseen by a chief architect ¡ª whose role is still to be determined . the air force expects to further define abms after analyzing different options for delivering the capability . that analysis is expected to be complete in summer 2019 .
chemistry contributes to virtually every aspect of modern life , and the chemical industry supports nearly 26 percent of the gross domestic product of the united states . while these are positive contributions , chemical processes and production can have negative health and environmental consequences . mitigating these potential consequences requires thoughtful design and evaluation of the life cycle effects of chemical processes and products . this testimony ¡ª based on a 2018 technology assessment , gao -18-307 ¡ª discusses ( 1 ) how stakeholders define and assess the sustainability of chemical processes and products , ( 2 ) available or developing technologies to make chemical processes and products more sustainable , ( 3 ) the roles of the federal government and others in supporting the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products , and ( 4 ) opportunities and challenges in the field of sustainable chemistry . for the 2018 report , gao selected for assessment three technology categories ¡ª catalysts , solvents , and continuous processing ; interviewed stakeholders from various fields , such as government , industry , and academia ; convened a meeting of experts on sustainable chemistry technologies and approaches ; and surveyed a non-generalizable sample of chemical companies . stakeholders vary in how they define and assess the sustainability of chemical processes and products ; these differences hinder the development and adoption of more sustainable chemistry technologies . however , based on a review of the literature and stakeholder interviews , gao identified several common themes underlying what sustainable chemistry strives to achieve , including : improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products while avoiding environmental harm ; reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances , minimize the use of non-renewable resources ; and consider all life cycle stages when evaluating a product ( see figure ) . there are many technologies available and in development that can improve chemical sustainability at each stage of the chemical life cycle . gao identified three categories of more sustainable chemistry technologies ¡ª catalysts , solvents , and continuous processing . catalysts are used to make chemical processes run faster or use less material . without catalysts , many everyday items such as medicines , fibers , fuels , and paints could not be produced in sufficient quantities to meet demand . however , the most common catalysts ¡ª including those used in automobile catalytic converters ¡ª are rare , nonrenewable metals such as platinum and palladium . researchers are working to replace such metals with alternatives , including abundant metals ( e.g. , iron and nickel ) where possible . solvents are used to dissolve other substances so reactions can occur , to separate and purify chemicals , and to clean the equipment used in chemical processes , among other uses . solvents constitute a large portion of the total volume of chemicals used in industrial chemical processes . however , many conventional solvents are considered hazardous . there are a variety of alternatives that can be used in some situations , including biobased solvents . an alternative to traditional batch processing is continuous processing , which allows chemical reactions to occur as the reaction mixture is pumped through a series of pipes or tubes where reactions take place continuously . compared to batch processing , this approach can improve product yield , product quality , and process safety while reducing waste and costs . the federal government and other stakeholders play several roles , sometimes in collaboration , to advance the development and use of more sustainable chemistry technologies . the federal government supports research , provides technical assistance , and offers certification programs , while other stakeholders conduct research , develop industry - specific standards , support workforce development development , and address chemicals of concern in consumer products , among other roles . strategic implications while using more sustainable options entails challenges -- including technological , business , and industry - wide and sector - specific challenges , the field of sustainable chemistry has the potential to inspire new products and processes , create jobs , and enhance benefits to human health and the environment . stakeholders identified strategic implications of sustainable chemistry and offered a range of potential options and realize the full potential of these technologies , including the following : breakthrough technologies in sustainable chemistry and a new conceptual framework could transform how the industry thinks about performance , function , and synthesis . an industry consortium , working in partnership with a key supporter at the federal level , could help make sustainable chemistry a priority and lead to an effective national initiative or strategy . integrating sustainable chemistry principles into educational programs could bolster a new generation of chemists , encourage innovation , and advance achievement in the field . a national initiative that considers sustainable chemistry in a systematic manner could encourage collaborations among industry , academia and the government , similar to the national nanotechnology initiative . there are opportunities for the federal government to address industry - wide challenges such as developing standard tools for assessment and a robust definition of sustainable chemistry . federal agencies can also play a role in demonstrating , piloting , and de-risking some technology development efforts . according to stakeholders , transitioning toward the use of more sustainable chemistry technologies will require national leadership and industry , government , and other stakeholders to work together .
em 's cleanup responsibilities include remediating contaminated soil and groundwater , deactivating and decommissioning contaminated facilities , and treating millions of gallons of radioactive waste that resulted from nuclear weapons produced during world war ii and the cold war . gao has reported on a wide range of challenges facing em , including management challenges and the office 's increasing environmental liability . in 2017 , gao added the u.s. government 's environmental liability to the list of program areas that are at high risk for fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement or in need of transformation . doe is responsible for over 80 percent of the federal government 's environmental liability . this testimony discusses ( 1 ) the status of doe 's environmental liability , ( 2 ) management challenges at em , and ( 3 ) em 's reporting on its cleanup efforts . it is based on five gao reports issued from january to march 2019 , updated with information from doe 's recent fiscal year 2018 agency financial report and 2020 budget request . in fiscal year 2018 , the department of energy 's ( doe ) estimated environmental liability ¡ª that is , its estimated probable costs of future environmental cleanup ¡ª was $ 494 billion . of this amount , doe 's office of environmental management ( em ) ¡ª which is responsible for most of doe 's cleanup activities ¡ª accounted for $ 377 billion . em 's portion of the liability reflects cleanup estimates for 16 sites across the united states . two of these , the hanford site in washington and savannah river site in south carolina , have most of em 's nuclear waste stored in tanks , which is particularly costly and complicated to treat . em 's environmental liability grew by $ 214 billion in fiscal years 2011 through 2018 , even though em spent over $ 48 billion on cleanup . gao found that this liability may continue to grow for several reasons : em 's environmental liability does not include the costs of all future cleanup responsibilities . for example , as of april 2018 , doe and its contractor had not negotiated a cost for completing a large waste treatment facility , called the waste treatment and immobilization plant , at the hanford site . about 30 to 60 percent of em 's cleanup budget goes toward recurring activities necessary to maintain the sites ¡ª such as physical security and infrastructure maintenance ¡ª rather than toward reducing em 's environmental liability . em officials have not analyzed the root causes of the cost growth . gao found that em has not resolved long - standing management challenges . first , em does not have a program - wide cleanup strategy and relies primarily on individual sites to locally negotiate cleanup activities and establish priorities , which does not always balance overall risks and costs . for example , the hanford and savannah river sites plan to treat similar radioactive tank waste differently , with hanford 's efforts possibly costing tens of billions more than savannah river 's . in addition , em manages most of its cleanup work as operations activities , under less stringent requirements than other environmental remediation projects . for example , operations activities are not subject to independent oversight outside em , and therefore doe can not hold em accountable for its performance . gao also found that em has not consistently reported to congress on its cleanup efforts as required , and the information em has reported has been incomplete or inaccurate . under the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 , em must annually report estimated costs and detailed funding needs for future cleanup activities . em 's fiscal year 2017 submission to congress was only the second one since fiscal year 2011 , and it did not include a detailed list of upcoming activities or funding needed to meet those activities . finally , gao found that information provided in em 's fiscal year 2016 to 2018 budget requests did not reflect the funding some doe officials said it needs to meet its milestones . budget requests for those years were for at least $ 1.5 billion less than the $ 8 billion a senior em official said em anticipated was needed annually to meet milestones called for in legally enforceable agreements .
a lapse in appropriations resulted in the federal government partially shutting down from december 22 , 2018 , to january 25 , 2019 . gao was asked to evaluate agency contingency plans and operations during the fy 2019 shutdown . this report assesses the extent to which selected agencies and selected components ( 1 ) had contingency plans that were consistent with applicable omb guidance , ( 2 ) planned for a potential prolonged shutdown and changed operations during the shutdown , and ( 3 ) had shutdown policies and procedures consistent with relevant internal control principles . gao selected cbp , irs , ita , and ustr as agency components for review because they are under the jurisdiction of the senate committee on finance and were affected by the fy 2019 shutdown . gao reviewed omb 's guidance , agencies ' contingency plans , and other documentation . gao interviewed agency and component officials . the office of management and budget ( omb ) issues shutdown guidance for agencies in circular a-11 . of four selected agency components , three ¡ª u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , the internal revenue service ( irs ) , and the international trade administration ( ita ) ¡ª operated in fiscal year ( fy ) 2019 under contingency plans that included most of the key information elements specified in circular a-11 . the plan that the fourth one ¡ª office of the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) ¡ª operated under , authored by the executive office of the president , did not include a majority of the key information elements . omb guidance instructs agencies to have plans in place for both short and prolonged ¡ª longer than 5 days ¡ª shutdowns . none of the four selected agencies ' fy 2019 contingency plans fully addressed anticipated changes in the event of a prolonged shutdown . gao found that irs , ita , and ustr internally discussed and planned for anticipated operational changes in the event of a prolonged fy 2019 shutdown . cbp officials said they only focused on short - term operational needs . having a comprehensive plan for a potential prolonged shutdown would help provide clearer workforce expectations during any future shutdowns . having sufficient internal controls , such as documented policies and procedures , in place prior to a shutdown can help agencies implement changes in day - to - day operations during a shutdown . selected agency components all incorporated some internal controls in their shutdown - related activities , as shown in the table below . however , none of the agency components had controls for limiting both physical and virtual workspace access for employees during a shutdown , each citing the difficulty of implementing such controls . having these controls in place would help components ensure that they operate consistently with their contingency plans and avoid misuse of government resources .
the ccdf is administered as a block grant to the states by occ , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) . recent reports by the hhs office of the inspector general show that occ 's monitoring of ccdf state program - integrity efforts remains a challenge . ccdf has also been designated as a program susceptible to significant improper payments , as defined by the office of management and budget . gao was asked to review ccdf program - integrity efforts . this report discusses , among other things , the extent to which occ provides oversight of ( 1 ) states ' ccdf program - integrity activities , including encouraging that all requested information is included within state plans ; and ( 2 ) improper - payment risks and relevant corrective actions in states ' ccdf programs . gao analyzed 51 approved ccdf state plans , including from the district of columbia , for the fiscal years 2019 ¨C 2021 grant period . gao also reviewed occ policies and procedures and compared them to relevant laws , regulations , and standards for internal control in the federal government , and interviewed relevant federal officials . the child care and development fund ( ccdf ) provided states more than $ 8 billion in federal funds in fiscal year 2019 . the office of child care ( occ ) oversees the integrity of the ccdf , which subsidizes child care for low - income families . a key part of occ 's oversight includes reviewing and approving state plans . occ requested but did not require states to describe in their state plans the results of their program - integrity activities , which describe the processes that states use to identify fraud risk . further , occ has not defined or communicated what information it considers to be the ¡° results ¡± of program - integrity activities to the states and its own staff . without defining and communicating its informational needs , occ may continue to lack quality information that could help ensure states ' accountability over their program - integrity activities . occ oversees states ' improper payment risks through a process that includes a requirement for states to submit corrective action plans ( cap ) when they estimate their annual payment error rates are at or above 10 percent . since 2013 , seven states have submitted 14 caps . these caps describe states ' proposed actions for reducing improper payments . however , occ does not have documented criteria to guide its review and approval of the caps to ensure the proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented . without developing this guidance , occ does not have assurance that proposed corrective actions are specifically aimed at root causes of improper payments , leaving the ccdf program at continued risk of improper payments .
the growth of the national debt , which is considered unsustainable under current policies , continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking . addressing a federal budget deficit that is unsustainable over the long run involves choices . fundamentally , the issues require deciding what government goods , services , and transfers are worth paying taxes for . most people would agree that the country benefits from a wide range of government services ¡ª air traffic controllers , border security , courts and corrections , and so forth ¡ª provided by the federal government . yet federal government provision of goods and services comprises only a modest portion of the federal budget . transfers , including interest payments , accounted for around 75 % of the federal budget . central findings of this analysis include the following : a comparatively small share of federal spending is for the direct provision of domestic government goods and services . transfers and payments to persons and to state and local governments constitute most of federal spending , about 75 % of all federal spending . defense spending , accounting for about 15 % of federal spending , has declined as a share of output over the past 35 years , but it also tends to vary depending , in part , on the presence and magnitude of international conflicts . the problem with the debt lies not in the past but in the future , as growth in spending for health and social security is projected to continue faster than the economy as a whole . the increase in deficits and debt , in turn , leads to a significant increase in interest payments . because much of the pressure on future spending arises from imbalances in social security and medicare part a ( hospital insurance ) trust funds , keeping these funds and their sources of financing intact is a concern that could constrain choices . preserving entitlements would likely require significant increases in taxes , such as raising rates , reducing tax expenditures , increasing other taxes , or introducing new revenue sources . reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level , so limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending , including entitlement programs such as social security , medicare , and medicaid . because the federal government provides about one - fifth of the revenue for state and local governments , cutbacks in transfers to these governments may , in part , shift the burden of providing services from the national to subnational governments rather than altering the overall size of government services .
despite a campaign pledge that they " would not arrest anyone as political prisoners , " aung san suu kyi and the national league for democracy ( nld ) have failed to fulfil this promise since they took control of burma 's union parliament and the government 's executive branch in april 2016 . while presidential pardons have been granted for some political prisoners , people continue to be arrested , detained , tried , and imprisoned for alleged violations of burmese laws . according to the assistance association of political prisoners ( burma ) , or aapp ( b ) , a thailand - based , nonprofit human rights organization formed in 2000 by former burmese political prisoners , there were 331 political prisoners in burma as of the end of april 2019 . during its three years in power , the nld government has provided pardons for burma 's political prisoners on six occasions . soon after assuming office in april 2016 , former president htin kyaw and state counsellor aung san suu kyi took steps to secure the release of nearly 235 political prisoners . on may 23 , 2017 , former president htin kyaw granted pardons to 259 prisoners , including 89 political prisoners . on april 17 , 2018 , current president win myint pardoned 8,541 prisoners , including 36 political prisoners . in april and may 2019 , he pardoned more than 23,000 prisoners , of which the aapp ( b ) considered 20 as political prisoners . aung san suu kyi and her government , as well as the burmese military , however , also have demonstrated a willingness to use burma 's laws to suppress the opinions of its political opponents and restrict press freedoms . the nld - led government arrested two reuters reporters who had reported on alleged murders of rohingya by tatmadaw soldiers , kyaw soe oo and wa lone , in december 2017 and charged them with violating the official secrets act of 1923 . on september 3 , 2018 , the two reporters were sentenced to seven years in prison . kyaw soe oo and wa lone were granted a presidential pardon on may 7 , 2019 , after serving 511 days in prison . in addition , aung ko htwe was sentenced to two years in prison with hard labor on march 28 , 2018 , following his august 2017 interview with radio free asia about his allegations that he was forced by the tatmadaw to become a " child soldier . " the union parliament has repealed or amended a few of the numerous laws that authorities use to arrest and prosecute people for political reasons , and further has passed new laws that some observers see as limiting political expression and protection of human rights . in addition , the tatmadaw , which directly or indirectly control the nation 's security forces ( including the myanmar police force ) , has not demonstrated an interest in ending burma 's history of political imprisonment . tatmadaw leaders have brought multiple defamation cases against journalists who publish stories critical of burma 's military . the burma political prisoners assistance act ( h.r. 2327 ) would make it u.s. policy to support the immediate and unconditional release of " all prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in burma , " and require the secretary of state to " provide assistance to civil society organizations in burma that work to secure the release of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in burma . " congress may consider if and how to integrate concerns regarding political imprisonment into overall u.s. policy in burma . congress may also choose to assess how other important issues in burma should influence u.s. policy , including efforts to end the nation 's ongoing low - grade civil war , the forced deportation of more than 700,000 rohingya from rakhine state , and prospects for constitutional and legal reform designed to establish a democratically elected civilian government that respects the human rights and civil liberties of all burmese people .
income and wealth inequality in the united states have increased over the last several decades . at the same time , life expectancy has been rising , although not uniformly across the u.s. population . taken together , these trends may have significant effects on americans ' financial security in retirement . gao was asked to examine the distribution of income and wealth among older americans , as well as its association with longevity , and identify the implication that these trends may have on retirement security . this report examines ( 1 ) the distributions of income and wealth among all older americans over time ; ( 2 ) the association between income , wealth , and longevity among older americans ; and ( 3 ) how the distributions of income and wealth changed over time for a cohort of individuals as they aged . to conduct this work , gao analyzed data from two nationally representative surveys : the scf , using data from 1989 through 2016 , and the hrs . gao used 1992 through 2014 hrs data linked to earnings records from the social security administration . while preliminary 2016 hrs data are available , gao used 2014 data , which contain more complete information for gao 's analysis . gao also reviewed studies and interviewed researchers to further analyze the relationships between income , wealth , longevity , and retirement security . disparities in income and wealth among older households have become greater over the past 3 decades , according to gao 's analysis of survey of consumer finances ( scf ) data . gao divided older households into five groups ( quintiles ) based on their income and wealth . each year of data in the analysis , and , thus , each quintile , included different sets of households over time . average income and wealth was generally higher over time ( see fig. 1 for average income ) , disproportionately so for the top quintile ( top 20 percent ) . for example , in 2016 , households in the top quintile had estimated average income of $ 398,000 , compared to about $ 53,000 for the middle quintile and about $ 14,000 for the bottom quintile . gao also found that for quintiles with lower wealth , future income from social security and defined benefit pensions provide a relatively significant portion of resources in retirement for those who expect such income . a substantial number of older americans born from 1931 through 1941 lived at least into their 70s or early 80s , according to gao 's analysis of data from the health and retirement study ( hrs ) , a nationally representive survey which follows the same individuals over time . gao divided individuals born from 1931 through 1941 into quintiles based on their mid-career household earnings using records from the social security administration . gao 's analysis , as well as that of other researchers , shows that differences in income , wealth , and demographic characteristics were associated with disparities in longevity . however , even with these disparities , we found a substantial number of people in the sample were alive in 2014 , including those with characteristics associated with reduced average longevity , such as low earnings ( see fig. 2 ) and low educational attainment . taken all together , individuals may live a long time , even individuals with factors associated with lower longevity , such as low income or education . those with fewer resources in retirement who live a long time may have to rely primarily on social security or safety net programs . gao 's analysis of hrs data also found that disparities in household income decreased while disparities in wealth persisted as a cohort of older americans aged from approximately their 50s into their 70s or early 80s . income disparities decreased between higher - and lower - earning households because higher - earning households saw larger drops in income over time , indicating the possible transition from working to retirement . for example , we estimated median income for the top mid-career earnings group decreased by 53 percent while estimated median income for the bottom earnings group decreased by 36 percent over the same period . wealth remained relatively steady for households in the bottom three earnings groups over the time period gao examined , while households in the top two earnings groups experienced larger fluctuations in wealth . gao estimated that median retirement account balances and median home equity increased across earnings groups for households that had these assets . however , the continued wealth disparities may be due to significant differences in the median value of retirement accounts and home equity between higher - and lower - earning households . gao also found that white households in the bottom two earnings groups had higher estimated median incomes , and white households in all earnings groups generally had greater estimated median wealth , than racial minority households in those earnings groups . in addition , within each earnings group , households headed by someone with at least some college education generally had higher median incomes and wealth than households headed by someone who did not attend college .
